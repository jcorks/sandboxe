Still under construction
------------------------

Sandboxe is a standalone tool that can be used to create new 
standalone game executables without the need for additional environment
setup or tremendous amounts of space. With all development 
done in Javascript/ECMAscript, Sandboxe is capable for anything 
from fast prototyping to fully-fledged multimedia projects.
