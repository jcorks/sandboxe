This was the old implementation for V8 in development.

While functional, in examples that required preserving JavaScript-sourced
objects past the conxtual lifetime implied by the source script,
programs would crash in what seemed to be premature removal of 
these objects. 

I spent a lot of time trying to get v8 to preserve these references, but 
no consistent solution seemed to hold. So for now, here lies the sandboxe 
runtime implementation for v8
