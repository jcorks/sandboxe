Import information:

v8 3.14.5

This was built on 5/21/2018 using the following tools:
- Scons 1.3.0 (zip, not installer. was installed into the python 
version mentioned below using ("python setup.py install")
- gcc/++ 4.9.2
- MINGW64 through MSYS 1.0
- Python 2.7.9


-Since it was possible to do this with MSYS 1.0, i'm fairly certain this 
could be done with MSYS2 and the paackage maintained tools. Scons would 
still need to be retrieved, though.

-IGNORE the scons warning about deprecation. 

- Build with:

scons arch=x64 toolhcain=gcc -Q I_know_I_should_build_with_GYP=yes
